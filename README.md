# Window-Manager-Backend
## Functionality
This is the back end, or the part without a GUI, to a window manager. However, it can be used without a front end. The manager currently has 4 sets of windows.
### Controls
The controls are CTRL+ALT+1, CTRL+ALT+2, CTRL+ALT+3, and CTRL+ALT+4 for different window setups. 1 and 2 have the same chrome windows while 3 and 4 are different. 
To launch each window set up you would do CTRL+SHFT+1 or some other number. After launching a set of windows, update them in to the application by pressing CTRL+ALT+0.
To clear all windows associated with the app press CTRL+ALT+c. **Additional documentation coming soon**.
